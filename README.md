# aws
# Overview
This repository contains my initial projects and exercises as I learn and explore AWS (Amazon Web Services). Here, I’m experimenting with basic services to build a foundational understanding of cloud computing.

# What’s Inside
  * Compute: Practicing with EC2 for virtual machines and Lambda for serverless functions.
  * Storage: Learning about S3 for file storage and basic bucket configurations.
  * Database: Setting up basic databases with RDS and exploring NoSQL with DynamoDB.
  * Networking: Configuring VPCs, subnets, and testing basic network setups.


# Goals
 > Gain hands-on experience with core AWS services.
 > Build simple projects to understand the basics of cloud infrastructure.
 > Document each project to track my learning progress.
